### Disclaimers

1. This is a personal initiative that does not represent my employer
2. Stars on a repo are not the only indicators of influence but it's the best one I can think of. If you can demonstrate influence with another metric that would be wonderful and will be taken into consideration!
3. The emphasis on having Arab origins is because I believe Arab contributors are an under represented group in the global open source community. Their work deserves some spotlight. This will also encourage and inspire the upcoming contributors from the region.
